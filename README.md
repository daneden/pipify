# PiPify

PiPify is a one-liner\* bookmarklet that lets you play videos in
picture-in-picture mode. This is especially useful for pages that block
right-click on video elements (common in video conferencing software and video
streaming).

\*“one-liner” is asterisked since the code is actually more than one line since
it also does some basic feature detection.
